# Denver Nightsky Helper (Python, In Progress, Fall 2025)
Python program using Skyfield (library) to calculate stargazing times and visible celestial objects with CSV export for the Denver area.  

In process, September 2025 (capstone project due 12/7/25).  

**Tech Stack**  

* Python  
* Skyfield library  
* Data structures: Dictionaries, Lists  
* File I/O: CSV  

**Features**  

* Computes sunset, dark sky, and sunrise times for Denver coordinates  
* Identifies visible planets and stars for chosen dates  
* Allows saving results to a CSV log for multi-day trip planning  
* Menu-driven interface with loops and input validation  

**Potential Upgrades**  

* Modification for other location coordinates (this program defaults to Denver, Colorado, USA coordinates)  
* Weather API integration to check for cloud cover or precipitation  
* Moon phase/brightness that might interfere with viewing objects  
* Add a calendar of known celestial events such as meteor showers for additional results output
